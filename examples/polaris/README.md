# Polaris - A New Product Development Case Study

This example shows sample path analysis applied to a new product development process. 
The context for this analysis can be found in our post [Little's Law in a Complex Adaptive System](https://www.polaris-flow-dispatch.com/i/172332418/the-polaris-case-study)

The specific scenario that we discussed in detail in that post can be found in the  [completed-stories-tukey](./work_tracking/complete-stories-tukey) directory.

In addition to those scenarios, we also have the following scenarios

- The stability analysis for [the defects sub-process](./work_tracking/defects)
- The stability analysis for [all completed stories without outlier filtering](./work_tracking/complete-stories)
- The divergence of [aging work](./work_tracking/aging-stories-defects) showing the stablity impact of unbounded open work. 
- The stabilization of [complete epics](./work_tracking/complete-epics)
- The divergence of [aging epics](./work_tracking/aging-epics)
