Task: Centralize color-config
Branch: color-config

Spec: I want to start extracting hard code colors all over the code base into a single color config object that lives on ChartConfig.

1. Lets extract the green and purple overlay colors first and change them centrally to forestgreen and rebeccapurple.
2. TBD
