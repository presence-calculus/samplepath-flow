Spec: We need to add event overlays to these Lambd(T) and w(T) charts. For Lambda(T) we should only use arrival events. For w(T) we should use both arrival and departure events.

Progress:
- Added Lambda(T) arrival overlays and w(T) arrival/departure overlays with arrival-only drop lines.
Status: done
