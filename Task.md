Task: Grid lines on charts
Branch: grid-lines
---

Spec: Enable grid-lines and minor axis ticks on charts.
1. Need to experiment with horizontal and vertical axes  and see visual impact. So try with a single panel first - say w(T)
2. Once we settle on a design choice, extend to all charts.
3. Add a CLI chart configuration option to enable/disable this choice globally. Will decide on default value later.
