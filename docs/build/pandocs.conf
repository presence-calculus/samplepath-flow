# -------- Configuration --------
# Map each SOURCE_DIR to a TARGET_DIR.
# You can mark a source as recursive by appending '/**' to it, e.g.:
#   "docs-src/**:docs"    # walk docs-src recursively
#   "docs-src:docs"       # only top-level + immediate subdirs (flat)
SOURCE_MAP=(
  "docs/articles/**:docs/site/articles"
  "docs/drafts/**:docs/site/drafts"
  "examples/**:docs/site/examples"
)

MATH_ENGINE="--mathjax"     # e.g., "--mathjax" or leave empty ""

# File extensions treated as static assets (copied as-is, not run through pandoc)
ASSET_EXTENSIONS=("png" "jpg" "jpeg" "gif" "svg" "css" "js" "pdf")
