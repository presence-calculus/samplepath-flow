# Sample Path Flow Metrics

This document is a catalog of charts generated by the sample path analysis toolkit.

Given an input sample path (an arrival/departure point process, as shown above), all
computations are deterministic. Every value depends only on event order and the elapsed
time between events on that path.

The charts are ordered by a canonical sample-path construction arc: each metric is
derived deterministically from prior metrics or directly from the sample path itself.

Each chart shows one or more metrics and their relationships to each other and to the
underlying events on the sample path. At any point in time, each metric value can be
traced to the _specific event(s)_ that produced it. That is what enables reliable
cause-and-effect analysis of flow-metric changes.

None of these calculations are statistical summaries, and none rely on probabilistic
assumptions. To repeat: given the input sample path, every value is fully determined.

Another key feature: canonical sample path flow metrics are indexed by _events_ on the
sample path. Calendar-indexed views are derived samples of the same event-resolved
calculations.
For theory and
formal definitions behind why this matters, see [Sample Path Theory]($document-root/articles/theory).

For CLI options and output contracts, see [Command Line Reference]($document-root/articles/cli).

# Notational Conventions

## Instantaneous vs cumulative values

- All charts are defined over a finite observation horizon of length
  $T_{\max}$.

- Lower-case $t$ denotes *instantaneous* time.

  For a fixed horizon $T \in (0,\,T_{\max}]$, the within-window time variable
  $t$ satisfies $0 \le t \le T$. Functions of $t$ (such as $N(t)$) denote
  instantaneous sample-path values at time $t$.

- Upper-case $T$ denotes a *prefix horizon*.

  Functions of $T$ are deterministic pathwise functionals over the prefix
  window. They represent _cumulative quantities_ or normalized quantities
  derived from them.

  For each $T$, we consider the prefix window $[0,\,T]$. Endpoint quantities
  such as $F(T)$ are values at $t=T$ for that window, and as $T$ varies over
  $(0,\,T_{\max}]$, these endpoint values form the trajectory
  $T \mapsto F(T)$.

All of these are deterministic, pathwise calculations (definite integrals,
discrete sums, and finite-window normalizations) and should not be confused
with statistical measures.

## Timescales and Indexes

All charts use continuous time on the x-axis.

- In event-indexed views, points are evaluated at exact event timestamps from the
  input sample path.
- In calendar-indexed views, points are evaluated at calendar boundaries, but values
  are still computed from the same underlying event-resolved pathwise calculations.

Internally, durations are measured in seconds and then durations and rates are converted automatically
to a consistent scale suitable for human-friendly display. This automatic scaling of units happens _on the y-axis only_;
the x-axis remains continuous time.

Calendar indexing is simply a coarser *sampling grid* over _metrics_ computed from the
event-resolved sample path at the input granularity. We do not pre-aggregate events into calendar buckets and then
compute flow metrics from those aggregates, like other flow metrics tools (incorrectly) do.

All the core charts shown in this document should be assumed to be event-indexed by default, unless explicitly specified otherwise.


## Event display

Event indexing is a key differentiator of sample path analysis, so charts are shown with event-resolved overlays by default: each plotted point is tied to an arrival or departure event. This makes the event-level impact on each flow-metric trajectory explicit. Arrival points are colored purple, departure points green, and each point includes a drop line to its x-axis timestamp. This detail is essential for deterministic cause-and-effect analysis.

Each chart also has a `--no-events` version with overlays removed. These views are useful for higher-level gestalt analysis of trajectories across views, especially in dashboards. When reviewing these charts, I recommend you take a look at both views to build intuition.


# The Presence Invariant Charts

The Presence Invariant is the finite-horizon form of Little’s Law.

$$
\begin{aligned}
L(T) &= \Lambda(T)\,w(T) = \Theta(T)\,w'(T)
\end{aligned}
$$

For the full derivation context and interpretation, refer to [Sample Path Theory: Presence Invariant]($document-root/articles/theory#presence-invariant).

The quantities in this law are the finite horizon equivalents of the quantities in the familiar steady state view of Little's Law,
But unlike the steady state version the presence invariant _holds unconditionally at all times_.

This document shows the step-by-step derivation of each quantity in the invariant and visualizes each component directly on the sample path. The charts are presented in a canonical order starting with the input sample path. Each chart depends on one more more metrics that we computed in an earlier chart. All calculations are deterministic.

Review the theory doc and use it as a cross-reference when reviewing the charts below. The ideas here are relatively straightforward if you spend a little bit of time carefully reading, understanding and reviewing what each chart means and the sequence of derivations.

</details>

This is the sample path, the input to sample path analysis. It is the observed behavior of some operational process modeled as a sequence of arrival and departure events on a timeline.

The sample path is represented as a timestamped event sequence with an indicator (a mark) at each timestamp. Here the mark indicates whether an event is an arrival or a departure. For core Presence Invariant calculations, this is sufficient.

The sample path encodes _non-deterministic process behavior_ along two dimensions: the discrete sequence of event types (including the ordering of arrivals and departures), and the continuous inter-event durations.

A useful mental model is a simple coin-flip process in which each flip determines whether the next event is an arrival or a departure. In addition to the outcome itself, we also care about the elapsed time between outcomes, which is the second dimension.

For this reason, this type of process is also called a _binary_ flow process. The same machinery extends naturally to a broader class of non-deterministic marked point processes, but this library currently implements only the binary case.

Note: An `id` mark that pairs arrivals with departures is _optional_ for the core invariant metrics, but _required_ for item-level sojourn-time measurements. This only becomes relevant when discussing convergence, stability and the familiar steady steady version of Little's Law.
