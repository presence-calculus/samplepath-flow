# Sample Path Flow Metrics

This document is a catalog of charts generated by the sample path analysis toolkit.

Given an input sample path (an arrival/departure point process, as shown above), all
computations are deterministic. Every value depends only on event order and the elapsed
time between events on that path.

The charts are ordered by a canonical sample-path construction arc: each metric is
derived deterministically from prior metrics or directly from the sample path itself.

Each chart shows one or more metrics and their relationships to each other and to the
underlying events on the sample path. At any point in time, each metric value can be
traced to the _specific event(s)_ that produced it. That is what enables reliable
cause-and-effect analysis of flow-metric changes.

None of these calculations are statistical summaries, and none rely on probabilistic
assumptions. To repeat: given the input sample path, every value is fully determined.

Another key feature: canonical sample path flow metrics are indexed by _events_ on the
sample path. Calendar-indexed views are derived samples of the same event-resolved
calculations.
For theory and
formal definitions behind why this matters, see [Sample Path Theory]($document-root/articles/theory).

For CLI options and output contracts, see [Command Line Reference]($document-root/articles/cli).

# Notational Conventions

## Instantaneous vs cumulative values

- All charts are defined over a finite observation horizon of length
  $T_{\max}$.

- Lower-case $t$ denotes *instantaneous* time.

  Functions of $t$ (such as $N(t)$) denote sample paths: values of a
  measurable process property at a specific moment
  $t \in [0,\,T_{\max}]$.

- Upper-case $T$ is a *prefix parameter*: a scalar value that determines a
  _finite observation window_ from the start of observation to the current
  prefix. Here we use $[0,\,T]$ as shorthand for that prefix window.

  Functions of $T$ are deterministic pathwise functionals over that prefix
  window. They represent _cumulative quantities_ or normalized quantities derived from them.  Here
  $T$ can range over any value in the observation window $(0,\,T_{\max}]$.

  All of these are deterministic, pathwise calculations (definite integrals,
  discrete sums, and finite-window normalizations) and should not be confused
  with statistical measures.

## Timescales

All charts use continuous time on the x-axis.

- In event-indexed views, points are evaluated at exact event timestamps from the
  input sample path.
- In calendar-indexed views, points are evaluated at calendar boundaries, but values
  are still computed from the same underlying event-resolved pathwise calculations.

Internally, durations are measured in seconds and then converted automatically
to a consistent scale suitable for human-friendly display. Units are automatically scaled on the _y-axis only_;
the x-axis remains continuous time.

Calendar indexing is simply a coarser *sampling grid* over _metrics_ computed from the
event-resolved sample path at the input granularity. We do not pre-aggregate events into calendar buckets and then
compute flow metrics from those aggregates, like most other flow metrics tools do.


# The Presence Invariant Charts

The Presence Invariant is the finite-horizon form of Little’s Law.

$$
\begin{aligned}
H(T) &= L(T)\,T = A(T)\,w(T) = D(T)\,w'(T) \\
L(T) &= \Lambda(T)\,w(T) = \Theta(T)\,w'(T)
\end{aligned}
$$

This document shows the step-by-step derivation of this law and visualizes each component directly on the sample path.

For the full derivation context and interpretation, refer to [Sample Path Theory: Presence Invariant]($document-root/articles/theory#presence-invariant) while walking through the charts.
